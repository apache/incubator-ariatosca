Aria's storage Sub-Package
Path: aria.storage

Storage package is a generic abstraction over different storage types.
We define this abstraction with the following components:

1. storage: simple mapi to use
2. driver: implementation of the database client mapi.
3. model: defines the structure of the table/document.
4. field: defines a field/item in the model.

API:
    * application_storage_factory - function, default Aria storage factory.
    * Storage - class, simple storage mapi.
    * models - module, default Aria standard models.
    * structures - module, default Aria structures - holds the base model,
                   and different fields types.
    * Model - class, abstract model implementation.
    * Field - class, base field implementation.
    * IterField - class, base iterable field implementation.
    * drivers - module, a pool of Aria standard drivers.
    * StorageDriver - class, abstract model implementation.
