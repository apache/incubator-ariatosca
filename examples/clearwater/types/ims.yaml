  ims.functions.HSS:
    description: >-
      The home subscriber server (HSS), or user profile server function (UPSF), is a master user
      database that supports the IMS network entities that actually handle calls. It contains the
      subscription-related information (subscriber profiles), performs authentication and
      authorization of the user, and can provide information about the subscriber's location and IP
      information. It is similar to the GSM home location register (HLR) and Authentication centre
      (AuC).

      A subscriber location function (SLF) is needed to map user addresses when multiple HSSs are
      used.

  ims.functions.CSCF:
    description: >-
      Several roles of SIP servers or proxies, collectively called Call Session Control Function
      (CSCF), are used to process SIP signalling packets in the IMS.
    derived_from: ims.functions.Root

  ims.functions.P-CSCF:
    description: >-
      A Proxy-CSCF (P-CSCF) is a SIP proxy that is the first point of contact for the IMS terminal.
      It can be located either in the visited network (in full IMS networks) or in the home network
      (when the visited network is not IMS compliant yet). Some networks may use a Session Border
      Controller (SBC) for this function. The P-CSCF is at its core a specialized SBC for the
      User–network interface which not only protects the network, but also the IMS terminal. The use
      of an additional SBC between the IMS terminal and the P-CSCF is unnecessary and infeasible due
      to the signaling being encrypted on this leg. The terminal discovers its P-CSCF with either
      DHCP, or it may be configured (e.g. during initial provisioning or via a 3GPP IMS Management
      Object (MO)) or in the ISIM or assigned in the PDP Context (in General Packet Radio Service
      (GPRS)).
    derived_from: ims.functions.CSCF

  ims.functions.I-CSCF:
    description: >-
      An Interrogating-CSCF (I-CSCF) is another SIP function located at the edge of an
      administrative domain. Its IP address is published in the Domain Name System (DNS) of the
      domain (using NAPTR and SRV type of DNS records), so that remote servers can find it, and use
      it as a forwarding point (e.g., registering) for SIP packets to this domain.
    derived_from: ims.functions.CSCF

  ims.functions.S-CSCF:
    description: >-
      A Serving-CSCF (S-CSCF) is the central node of the signalling plane. It is a SIP server, but
      performs session control too. It is always located in the home network. It uses Diameter Cx
      and Dx interfaces to the HSS to download user profiles and upload user-to-S-CSCF associations
      (the user profile is only cached locally for processing reasons only and is not changed). All
      necessary subscriber profile information is loaded from the HSS.
    derived_from: ims.functions.CSCF

  ims.functions.AS:
    description: >-
      SIP Application servers (AS) host and execute services, and interface with the S-CSCF using
      SIP. An example of an application server that is being developed in 3GPP is the Voice call
      continuity Function (VCC Server). Depending on the actual service, the AS can operate in SIP
      proxy mode, SIP UA (user agent) mode or SIP B2BUA mode. An AS can be located in the home
      network or in an external third-party network. If located in the home network, it can query
      the HSS with the Diameter Sh or Si interfaces (for a SIP-AS).

      The AS-ILCM (Application Server - Incoming Leg Control Model) stores transaction state, and
      may optionally store session state depending on the specific service being executed. The
      AS-ILCM interfaces to the S-CSCF (ILCM) for an incoming leg. Application Logic provides the
      service(s) and interacts between the AS-ILCM and AS-OLCM.

  ims.functions.AS-OLCM:

      The AS-OLCM (Application Server - Outgoing Leg Control Model) stores transaction state, and
      may optionally store session state depending on the specific service being executed. The
      AS-OLCM interfaces to the S-CSCF (OLCM) for an outgoing leg. Application Logic provides the
      service(s) and interacts between the AS-ILCM and AS-OLCM.

  ims.functions.MRF:
    description: >-
      The Media Resource Function (MRF) provides media related functions such as media manipulation
      (e.g. voice stream mixing) and playing of tones and announcements.

      Each MRF is further divided into a media resource function controller (MRFC) and a media
      resource function processor (MRFP).
    derived_from: ims.functions.Root

  ims.functions.MRFC:
    description: >-
      The MRFC is a signalling plane node that interprets information coming from an AS and S-CSCF
      to control the MRFP.

  ims.functions.MRFP:

      The MRFP is a media plane node used to mix, source or process media streams. It can also
      manage access right to shared resources.
    derived_from: ims.functions.Root

  ims.functions.MRB:
    description: >-
      The Media Resource Broker (MRB) is a functional entity that is responsible for both collection
      of appropriate published MRF information and supplying of appropriate MRF information to
      consuming entities such as the AS. MRB can be used in two modes:
      * Query mode: AS queries the MRB for media and sets up the call using the response of MRB
      * In-Line Mode: AS sends a SIP INVITE to the MRB. The MRB sets up the call
    derived_from: ims.functions.Root

  ims.functions.BGCF:
    description: >-
      A Breakout Gateway Control Function (BGCF) is a SIP proxy which processes requests for routing
      from an S-CSCF when the S-CSCF has determined that the session cannot be routed using DNS or
      ENUM/DNS. It includes routing functionality based on telephone numbers.
    derived_from: ims.functions.Root

  ims.functions.PTSNGateway:
    description: >-
      A PSTN/CS gateway interfaces with PSTN circuit switched (CS) networks. For signalling, CS
      networks use ISDN User Part (ISUP) (or BICC) over Message Transfer Part (MTP), while IMS uses
      SIP over IP. For media, CS networks use Pulse-code modulation (PCM), while IMS uses Real-time
      Transport Protocol (RTP).
    derived_from: ims.functions.Root

  ims.functions.SGW:
    description: >-
      A signalling gateway (SGW) interfaces with the signalling plane of the CS. It transforms lower
      layer protocols as Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP, an IP protocol) into Message
      Transfer Part (MTP, an Signalling System 7 (SS7) protocol), to pass ISDN User Part (ISUP) from
      the MGCF to the CS network.
    derived_from: ims.functions.PTSNGateway

  ims.functions.MGCF:
    description: >-
      A media gateway controller function (MGCF) is a SIP endpoint that does call control protocol
      conversion between SIP and ISUP/BICC and interfaces with the SGW over SCTP. It also controls
      the resources in a Media Gateway (MGW) across an H.248 interface.
    derived_from: ims.functions.PTSNGateway

  ims.functions.MGW:
    description: >-
      A media gateway (MGW) interfaces with the media plane of the CS network, by converting between
      RTP and PCM. It can also transcode when the codecs don't match (e.g., IMS might use AMR, PSTN
      might use G.711).
