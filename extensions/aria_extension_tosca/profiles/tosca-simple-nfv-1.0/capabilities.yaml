    description: >-
      Enhance compute architecture capability that needs to be typically use for performance sensitive NFV workloads.
    derived_from: tosca.capabilities.Container
    properties:
      mem_page_size:
        description: >-
          Describe page size of the VM:
  
          * small page size is typically 4KB
          * large page size is typically 2MB
          * any page size maps to system default
          * custom MB value: sets TLB size to this specific value
        type: string

        #  - [ normal, huge ]
      cpu_allocation:
        description: >-
          Describes CPU allocation requirements like dedicated CPUs (cpu pinning), socket count, thread count, etc.

      numa_nodes:
        description: >-
          Asymmetric allocation of vCPU and Memory across the specific NUMA nodes (CPU sockets and memory banks).
  
          NOTE: symmetric numa_node_count should not be specified.
